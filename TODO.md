# TODO

1. Update `./view.py/create_values` to be more performant.
2. Update the table at the bottom of the page to look nicer/have more data on screen for the users.
3. Come up with a bit of a slicker data model approach. My lack of pandas knowledge hurt me a bit here.
4. Write more generative unit tests for better coverage.
5. Look into async generation of graph and table.
6. Actually cache the table.
7. Error handling.
